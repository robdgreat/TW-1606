<h2>Chapter 6: Cruel and Unusual Punishment</h2>
<p>
Well, now you know how to be an evil, you've got the ships, got the money, got the fighters. Thats all fine and dandy, but hey, have you been killing the competition? Lets face it, the easiest targets for you to kill, and undoubtedly the most profitable for the cost of locating and killing, are other evils. Don't just sit around and let them make cash to fuel badass goodies of their split corp, be agressive, put those fighters to use. Head over the the grimy, have him start tracing em, get a recent hit (as in, he ported somewhere TODAY) and go slaughter their ass. Try not to trip fighters as you head in, you might have to walk a long route to find a quiet way in. Kick some ass, take some names. If you can manage to nail his pod as well, then look around a bit. Undoubtedly his tow-fight ship will be nearby (typically a corporate flag), and unmanned the fighters defending it will die VERY easily. So hell with it, kill that ship :) it'll cost you alot less to kill it then it'll cost him to replace.

Also be constantly on the lookout for early goodie bases, you may be able to take them over yourself early, or just supply a goodie in your split-group and have him do it. With a good iss using friend, you should be able to easily take out most any early game base, even easier if you can get a few evils working with you.

I do hope you have found this, instructional. Of course there are a few things I have, ahem, left out. But these things are beyond the scope of this lesson in evilness. Hopefully you have found it, educational.
