<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
This is a bit of a guide, gives some strategy, and explains some ways to successfully play as an evil in Tradewars 2002. You might disagree, you might have better ideas, hell, you might have a better startup. But then again, so do I ;p. I just decided I'd throw up a basic startup to help out the people who are sick of playing a goodie, or newer players who can't seem to get an evil character running. It figures you have some knowledge of tradewars, and if you don't, read something like tradewars for dummy's or play the game a little while. I'm also not including exact instructions on blocking SD and creating scripts. These are things you can find elsewhere, and can come up with yourself if thats what floats yer boat. In any case good luck with you, and if you can't handle the pressures of being evil, you can simply read my GOOD guidebook, which I'll be throwing together soon.
