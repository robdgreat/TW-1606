<h2>Chapter 5: Stayin Alive, Stayin Alive</h2>
<p>
Now your doing well, stealing up a storm, probably have 5k+ exp and are stealing a good amount of holds (up to 250 depending on how hard the busts are in your particular game). Your making cash out the ass, and theres only one problem. Just about everyone wants you dead. Their not stupid :) your like an ATM, kill you and they can steal your cash, sell your colts, and in general make a whole lot of credits. Even better, your forced to use a big huge piece of crap ship for sst'ing in. A colt wont last 2 seconds vs just about anything. As if that isn't bad enough, your typically sitting at the same set of ports for an extended period of time to make cash. This makes you EXTREMELY vournerable to the grimy trader :(.
</p><p>
Your best bet at staying alive early on, is to lay fighters literally everywhere you go. All over the place, 1 fighter here, 1 fighter there. Try to make sure that if anyone tries to come at you, you'll have plenty of advance warning. At the first sign of a fig hit, jump back into your bigger "fighting ship/tow ship" and either run like hell, or go kick some ass. If you've played your cards right you should have a good amount of fighters, and a decent amount of exp. This should put you at least competetive in a fight with pretty much anyone. Of course however corps can put up a good amount of figs for a "designated fighter". So in any case if you see someone decent coming, you might want to get the hell out of there.

And speaking of corps, you should definately be in one. Either get a few evils together for a corp, or try to get some evils/goods (IE a split or "mega corp"). If you do have goodies as part of your split corp, feed them well. They will typically (unless the game is heavily edited) have FAR superior ships, and the capability to build. In other words, you supply them the cash, and they'll help kill off the competition, while building up some nice planets. Later on they can give you a few level 4+ planets, and you can use these to start up advanced cash making, like loading ports with cash to megarob, and steal dump transport (although you can do steal dump transport with planets of any level really, it just takes some setup to turn a profit).
