<p>
Hey, we all know how easy it is to be a little pansy goodie goodie. Hiding in fedspace under 1000 exp, being nice, defending things, colonizing (vomit).
</p><p>
I've gotta say I'm glad to hear you want turn to the dark side, just think of all the perks.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>You get to jettison colonists all you want!</li>
  <li>You get to fly typically insuperior ships!</li>
  <li>You get hunted by every goodie, evil guy, and grandmother!</li>
  <li>You get to refurbish your holds non-stop and feel the joys of busting!</li>
  <li>You get to blow alot of planets up!</li>
  <li>You get to enjoy never being completely safe, ever!</li>
  <li>You get to be red instead of that wimpy looking blue color!</li>
  <li>You get to sit around instead of colonizing and upgrading planets!</li>
  <li>You get to steal stuff!</li>
  <li>Oh yeah, you make lots of credits too!</li>
</ol>  
<p>
Still here?
Well, I'm glad to see your not easily scared off, the prospects of being an evil are quite, grim, but the benefits can outweigh that. I must say either your quite brave or very stupid, but I'll help you out anyway for sticking around.
