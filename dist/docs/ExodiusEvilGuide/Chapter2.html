<h2>Chapter 2: In the beginning</h2>
<p>
Lets face it, usually the ship you start in deserves to be scrap metal. Always check the specs, but in a stock game it'll have a 3 turn per warp engine, and only 75 holds max. Even worse, in most games you start out with 300 credits. I mean c'mon, you couldn't buy toothpaste with 300 credits.
</p><p>
Well, typically theres a simple solution, the Merchant Freighter. At 2 turns per warp with 65 holds max, this ship is a bit more efficent then the cruiser at trading. Plus, at 2 turns per warp it is much less costly moving around actually finding trading ports. If your in early enough, hell with it, trade that piece of crap cruiser in first thing, get yourself a freighter with the cash from the trade. Now you'll have gained a few holds, and have enough cash for a few fighters or shields, and a density scanner (ahem, IMPORTANT, always get a density scanner early). This is all banking on you being able to successfully get to the stardock. Easier said then done, but with advanced stardock blocking techniques out there today, most TW sysops are placing the dock next to fedspace to make things easier. There are still potential problems with this, but with any luck you'll be in a merchant freighter and trading away in no time.

Remember, this ship is just to get you started. Deck her out with holds, fire a few e-probes to find good pair port areas, and make some cash/exp (you have to be haggling here, exp will soon turn into big money, use a script or helper if possible). Also, while trading lay down fighters here and there when you find XXB ports fairly clustered in an area, and put 1 down at every pair port you trade down.

Another thing to know is this is a Passive Startup. It will get you decent cash and exp, but it's not made to be agressive on day 1. I consider agressive startup's (stardock blocking, mass killing, hunting, spending early cash on figs) as more advanced tatics that you should dig into yourself.
