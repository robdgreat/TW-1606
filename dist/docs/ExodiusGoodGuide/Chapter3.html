Well, by now you've traded down most or all of your turns and should have a sizeable sum of cash, in a loaded merchant freighter. It's time for you to prepare for a federal comission. To do so, your going to need 500 good alignment. Theres several ways to go about getting this, but heres the fairly cost effective.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cross pod with an evil. This would be basically starting with both of you around 1000 experience, you kill him once, he kills you once, you kill him a second time, he kills you a second time. This will make you decent good if he's decently evil, and only costs a few fighters and a couple merchant freighters (all escape pod equipped ships only contain 2, so you'll need 2 new freighters to safely do it, remember, scouts dont have pods). Also, remember you can only safely get podded twice in one day, third time is the "big sleep". The downside to this is, it gets you over 1000 experience. Course you can always lower your exp using exp lowering techniques, and that makes this a good way of doing things. Also, it'll leave you with most or all of the cash you made trading, for you to spend on an iss, holds, t-warp, etc.</li>
  <li>Post rewards on evils. You can do this in the police station, 1 good alignment per 1,000 credits posted. Thus it'll take 500,000 credits to make enough alignment to get comissioned. This is a lot more costly then crosspodding, but typically you cant crosspod, and this will not effect your experience.</li>
</ol>
  
<p>
Alone this will get you an iss on day 1 or day 2, depending on your success at trading and your choice of alignment gain. However, you should be in a corp, and in that case you can pool your collective cash to buy at least 1 ISS on day one, complete with full holds, a twarp drive, and a compliment of fighters, or alternatively, low fighters, saving the cash and starting a "bubble". At this point you could try blockaiding stardock through the use of scripts, photon rain, etc, but I am explaining a passive startup, you can explore this option on your own.
</p><p>
Now that you have an ISS with full holds and a twarp drive (this is the main goal to attain), it's time to move on, to planetary building, and bubble development.
