<h2>Chapter 4: The trouble with bubbles</h2>
<p>
For those who don't know, a "bubble" is, it's several sectors connected together, with only 1 exit. For example, 3 sectors in a line, the one in back has 1 exit, to the second sector, the second sector only has 2 exits, to the very back, and to the front door. The front door has 2 exits, one to the middle room, and one, back out into space (IE, a sector with alot of exits etc). Some bubbles are bigger then others, and typically they aren't in a straight line, instead branching off a bit behind the "front door" sector. You can find bubbles like this by luck (while you were trading) or through the use of a helper (typically using zero turn mapping, and a bubblefinder script). One thing to remember though, try not to pick the biggest bubble on your helper list. These will undoubtedly be probed alot by everyone who's looking through bubbles. Just pick one a bit further down the list and your a "bit" safer. Maybe in the 4-6 or 7 room bubble range.
</p><p>
Inside a bubble like this, you place planets. Good planets to typically place, in stock games that is, would be L class, H class, and O class. Some games have edited planets, you might want to ask about them first. In any case, the L classes will be your first to hit level 3 (AKA quasar level) and become your early defence. The H classes will take longer to build, but will eventually be your BADASS defence planets. While the O class planets will become your cash-cow's. They make 1 organics for every 2 colonists on the planet working organics. This means with a decent amount of colonists, these will produce tens of thousands of organics every day, making you millions of credits worth of profit. Typically you want 1 O class in every bubble sector (at least 1). And if possible, you want as many organics buying ports in there as possible (build them in bubble sectors that are empty).
</p><p>
Now, to start out your planets, start blowing em in a bubble sector, and IF POSSIBLE, do it in a bubble sector with a SBX port SBS being prefered. If you dont like what they give you, detonate it and make another (this will make some navhaz, but making another planet will clean that up). Typically you can only place 5 planets in a sector without "overloading" it (overloading a sector will cause 2 planets to collide at extern). Again, try to get an L class, H class, and O class to start out with. Ok, so you've got your planets up now, time to get some colonists in here. But first, your going to need the all importaint t-warp resource, FUEL! To start out we'll want to haul some fuel onto the planet we plan on colonizing. Later on this will be easier, with the L or H class making the fuel at a decent rate of speed. So, port, buy a full load of fuel, dump on planet, rinse, repeat. Use a macro or something to do this :) so you can quickly drain the few thousand fuel off the port. Ok, now the port is drained and your planet has about 2k fuel on it (give or take depending on how much was in the port). I suggest strongly that you start by colonizing the H class planet. It will make fuel very very fast, thus helping you colonize more and easier in the first couple days. Now, go into your ship computer and plot the course between your planet, and sector 1. Then, plot the course from sector 1, to your sector. Add these 2 distances together (for instance, 9 hops to sector 1, 9 hops back, making 18 total hops). It takes 3 holds of fuel for every hop you travel with the transwarp drive. This means you need to take total distance * 3.
</p>
<p>
So, in our example it would be 18*3=54. So, you will need 54 fuel to make a round trip flight. Grab 54 fuel, fly to sector 1 with the twarp, land, grab colonists off terra, fly back to your bubble by t-warp, dump colonists, grab 54 fuel, repeat. This will go much faster with a script or macro, and also helps if you turn off ansi cinematics. Quickly you'll have drained your planet of fuel and stuck quite a few colonists on it. If you are working with a corp, SHARE the ISS you have with the others, help them get comissions to aid in colonist hauling, and in loading fuel etc. Now, start the planet building a citadel. For an H class I believe this takes about 1800 colonist units, and a good chunk of equipment, fuel, and organics. Try to get it started, then move enough colonists to the L class, as well as enough fuel/equipment/organics to get it started too. Then put all the colonists back on the H class. They don't have to stay on a planet to finish a citadel, and they'll make more fuel on the H class for more colonizing. You dont really have to start a citadel on the O class if you dont want to right away, it's a bit helpful to have L4 O classes later on, but for now it's no biggie.

Congratulations, your well on your way to becoming a galactic powerhouse.
