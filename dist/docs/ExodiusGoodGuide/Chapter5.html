<h2>Chapter 5: The quick and the dead</h2>
<p>
Well, now your bubble is started off, and of course, your going to want to keep it alive. You invest alot of time in populating it, alot of cash in upgrading it, and have probably started to upgrade organics buying ports, getting them ready to start selling loads of organics any day now. In any case, heres a few thoughts on early defence.
</p>
<p>
Early on, your bubble is very vournerable. Pretty much everything can be photon'ed and disabled, making any potential early quasars rather ineffectual. Sector fighters will also be rendered useless. And you can't defend level 0-1 planets with figs (they have to be level 2 before fighters on the planet will defend, below level 2, and the enemy can simply land and take the fighters for himself). Your best bets for survival through this crucial stage are as follows,
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>HUNT FOR EVILS!</b> Use grimy trader, track them down, kill them ruthlessly. Left alone evils will very very quickly make the cash to search the universe, find your sector, and to overtake it in it's infancy. Or alternatively they will make their cash, hand it over to their mega-corp teammates (goods) and let THEM find and take out your sector. In any case, evils will have the resources available to take down basically any young sector, kill them off as much as possible, and you in turn protect yourself.</li>
  <li><b>CHANGE YOUR SHIP NAME REGULARLY!</b> Since you will be porting in ports inside your bubble occasionally with your iss, change your ship name every chance you get. Otherwise, people will simply use the grimy trader on you and be given an exact location. On the same note, if you are going to sleep overnight in a ship OTHER then the iss (IE, to let others use the ISS) make sure NOT to port in any ports, in the ship you sleep in. So if you get a tholian to sleep in or something, simply bring it in, and never port it, then your safe from grimy for as long as your inside it.</li>
  <li><b>Keep an eye out for other goodie bases.</b> Just as your bubble is vournerable, so is theirs. And if you have an evil working for you, it is even easier to overtake.</li>
  <li><b>You can try out tholian sentinels.</b> They do work in current versions of TW. Long as you are inside one, in a sector with corporate planets, it'll take a decent amount of power to kill. This wont save you from well funded iss users, but it should be enough to keep some people away if they do find your area.</li>
  <li><b>Always check for limpits before flying your iss home.</b> It only takes a few seconds to make a quick t-warp stop at SD before t-warping home, it might save your life. I can't tell you how many people I've seen moronically drag limpits home. Even worse, they all deny they did it. Don't let this happen to you, port at SD regularly.</li>
</ol>
