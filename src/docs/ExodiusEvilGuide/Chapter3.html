<h2>Chapter 3: Movin on up</h2>
<p>
Well, now you have probably played down most or all of day 1, have some decent cash, and somewhere around 1k exp (give or take, depends on turns, port density, and the amount of traders out there). Time to go evil, jettison a load of colonists and if your not -100 yet go post a reward or two in the underground until you are.
</p><p>
This is a critical point. You can do a few different things here.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Buy a decent fighting ship, load it up with some figs, and do a little killing. Good ships for this type of play on day 1-2 are typically things like a havoc gunstar, a starmaster, a constellation (check ship specs for a decent attack odds ship with 3 turns per warp or so, transwarp drive is a plus). Alternatively you could buy a missile frigate and try photon rain from SD in a form of SD block strategy.</li>
  <li>Buy a t-warp capable ship, and get a couple SST ships to tow around. Start SST'ing (steal sell transport for those who don't know). Obviously this is alot better if you can get your hands on a corporate flagship. In any case check your settings, in some games there are decent t-warp ships available to the non-ceo evil for you to use. If possible get a ship with over 80 holds and a t-warp, if it's a stock game and your not a ceo, settle with a havoc.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If you picked fighting, well, I think you can handle that on your own. However, if you decided to sst at this point then lets move on :)
