<h2>Chapter 4: The joys of stealing</h2>
<p>
Well, now you have a tow-ship (with t-warp type 2 installed, and a load of holds for fuel). Hopefully your carrying 2k+ exp, and have a couple decent SST ships. Typically they are either mules (150 holds max) or colonial transports (typically called colts, which have 250 holds max). It's time to start sst'ing.
</p><p>
First off, find a decent area with XXB ports. If you laid down figs while trading earlier, this should be no problem at all. T-warp tow in your sst ships into 2 sepperate XXB port sectors. Now, upgrade the ports a little bit. 1 upgrade of equipment units = 10 equipment on dock in the port. Thus, if you are stealing around 100 holds of equipment, upgrade the port 11 or 12 (this way, theres a bit extra in the port so you can keep stealing without having to worry about your equipment amount on dock going down below 100).
</p><p>
Now you decide how much your going to SST. This is fairly easy to calculate, but might take a few tries before you can figure out the best setting for the particular game. Typical calculations are holds*20=exp required, up to holds*30=exp required. Skimp too much and you'll get busted alot, go too high and you'll be making alot less then you potentially can.
</p><p>
Now, start the cycle, port, steal X holds of equipment (X being however much you can according to your exp) port, sell equipment, haggle for exp. Transport to other ship, port, steal equipment, port, sell equipment, transport.
</p><p>
Never steal from the same port twice in a row or you will be busted. And once you've busted at a port, try not to port or steal there again for a good while. Just move the busted ship to another XXB port, upgrade the port, and start again.
Now your making cash, busting occasionally, and sst'ing. Sounds like the perfect time to go over what you need to do to stay a successful evil.
</p><p>
First off, PLANET BUST. Spend most of your early cash making planets, and blowing em up. This will make you 75 exp for every 35k or so and costs very very few turns. You have to do this alot, but this will help you get your exp up higher and higher, with the intent to get high enough to successfully steal 250 holds regularly.
</p><p>
A second little trick is refurbing with merchant freighters. Basically, you buy a merchant freighter, deck it with holds, and kill it with the colt you busted in. This will fill your holds back up a bit. This is usually best when your dealing with 250 holds, as it is considerably cheaper to spend 45k or so on a decked merchant freighter to fill up the holds you lose when you bust at 250 then to drag the colt back and manually buy them (those 20 some odd holds are VERY expensive). In other words, early on it might be cheaper to fill your colts manually, but once you get up in the 200 hold range, it's best to get your holds off salvage. Just remember, attack the merchant freighter with 1 fighter, you'll blow it up for 20 some holds.
</p><p>
Later on you can use advanced moneymaking techniques. These ususally require alot of experience, and include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Rob transport Rob</b> (a 4 turn cycle used when ports don't have enough credits to mega-rob, this can make a "lot" of cash using exp*3=credits through exp*10=credits depending on the game, your exp, and how hard the ratio is set).</li>
  <li><b>Steal Dump Transport</b> (a 4 turn cycle where you load a port with equipment, steal, dump it on the planet, transport, steal, dump, transport, it requires 2 planets and some startup cash but is considerably more profitable then sst'ing, when done ya simply sell back the equipment from the planet to the port using a planetary trade).</li>
  <li><b>Buy Dump, MEGAROB</b> (This is where you load a port up to sell alot of equipment, buy it all down using a overprice buy script, IE buying for about 30-35% more then their asking for, filling the port with over 3.4 million credits, then robbing all your cash back with 1 megarob, course then you move your planet to an upgraded equipment buying port and sell it all back, takes VERY few turns and turns HUGE profit with extremely little chance of busting).</li>
</ul>
