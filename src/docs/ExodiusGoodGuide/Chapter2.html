<h2>Chapter 2: Let's get busy</h2>
<p>
Well, you've started out, soon you'll be on your way to ruling your own personal galactic empire. But first, lets get you out of that merchant cruiser and into a more profitable early game trading ship, the merchant freighter. Of course, check your game's ship specifications first, but usually a merchant freighter will be around 7% more efficent at flat out trading compared to the cruiser. As an added bonus, the freighter uses only 2 turns per warp in stock games, while the cruiser uses 3. This means you spend less turns actually moving from port pair to port pair. And if that isn't good enough, through trading your cruiser for a freighter first thing, you will gain a few holds, and have enough cash left over from the trade to buy some fighters or shields, and a density scanner (which is VERY importaint).

Time to start trading, make yourself some cash, and get that merchant freighter decked out with holds, and a holoscanner, as well as some more defensive fighters or shields. Grab a few ether probes too, fire them to find new pair ports easier. You can decide yourself on haggling or not. It is suggested you don't haggle, so as to stay under 1000 experience (and thus stay fedspace protected) for as long as possible. If you do haggle you'll make a bit more profit, but will have to use a exp-loss technique to stay fedsafe. For instance allowing a evil friend to pod you a couple times. Or by guessing the password to the underground wrong several times (U in stardock, it's a hidden area). Just remember, if you are using an exp-loss technique, deposit your cash first, or let a corp mate hold it (I believe in the underground if you guess wrong twice you get mugged and credits taken, 3 times you lose half your exp, 4 times you get murdered).
