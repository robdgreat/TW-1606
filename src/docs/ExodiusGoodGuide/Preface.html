<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
This is a bit of a guide, gives some strategy, and explains some ways to successfully play as a goodie goodie in Tradewars 2002. You can disagree with anything here, you might like doing things differently, and hell, ya might say it could be better. I understand this, I am not trying to make uber-goods, I am simply attempting to help the less fortunate grasp how to start, play, and be a successful good. This guide should lead you through the basics, and intermediate action, with a few advanced topics. It figures you have some knowledge of tradewars, and if you don't, read something like tradewars for dummy's or play the game a little while. In any case just remember, if you cant cut it on the good side, simply give the evil side a go (and you can read Exodius's EVIL Guidebook to get you started). A bit of work, a bit of practice, and you'll find your "nitch", an attacker, a builder, a moneymaker, etc. As with the evil guide, this is a "passive" startup, and doesn't involve being agressive on day 1. If you want to do something like this, then I'll leave it up to you to come up with your own strategies for attacking.
