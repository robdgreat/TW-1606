<h2>Chapter 7: In conclusion</h2>
<p>
Anyway, that should give any goodie goodie a fine start on the road to victory. Sure, some things were deliberately left out, and I stayed vague on agressive early game strategies. But these things are beyond the scope of this guidebook. This will get you going, and with any luck will help you become very successful. If you really want to learn how to write agressive scripts like auto photon to tripped fighter, or the old attack tricks, it will take some practice, a knack for fighting, and perhaps a mentor willing to share. As far as more advanced lategame strategy, this too is a bit beyond what I'm trying to get across here. But if you survive that long, you shouldn't have any trouble figuring out what to do.
