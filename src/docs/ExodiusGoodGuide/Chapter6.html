<h2>Chapter 6: Advanced topics and lategame</h2>
<p>
Well, now your making cash, organics farming many oceanic planets, have fighters coming out your ears, and a very good home sector defence. So, what do you do? Kill everyone of course. This is the point in time when you go out and kill everyone in your power. Take out enemy bases, kill those evils, try to get your alignment up (through killing of evils) enough to kill goods without problems. Play your cards right and you (and your corp) will be competetive, or even winning. In any case, you should be fairly ruthless at this point, kill first, answer the stupid whiners later.
</p><p>
Another little topic would be further advanced bubble defences. Usually you move your larger bruiser planets (and any others you take) to your front sector or two. Obviously you can only have 5 to a room, but a couple L5 H classes and a few L class's (which would be level 5-6 at this time) makes for a fairly killer front end. Just remember to shield them well, to keep them protected from photons. Also, turn the first planet in the room (the lowest planet number in the room) to a LOW sector cannon. Depening on the amount of fuel present on the planet, 1-7% should be acceptable. Basically your trying to make the first planet that fires, fire a small shot of 1k damage through 2k damage, to kill small ships.
</p><p>
Set the second cannon for around a 4k-10k shot, and the rest as you like (though usually your trying to do enough damage to pod a decked ISS). This will prevent "mothing" a technique used to drain enemy planets of fuel to make them easier to kill. People do this by flying small "cheap" ships into the room, to take quasar hits. If you set all your planets real high on the sector, people are simply going to fly in and blow hundreds of thousands of your fuel for the cost of a few merchant freighters. And remember, set atmosphere shots high enough to blast anything that attempts to land. Considering the sector shots damage, this should only have to be 20k damage through 40k damage (depends on ship edits, plus now and then people will try hitting you with a decked intradictor, 100k figs). Also, don't turn on military reaction on the planet. This will cause wasteful use of fighters on the planet offensively, which will only get 1.0 offensive odds. Compared to letting them stay on the planet and defend at 2.0 odds, making it twice as effective to let them defend. Besides, if your quasars are set right on those level 5+'s you shouldn't have to worry about much of a ship surviving the blasts.
</p><p>
One more thing to mention about planets, though known to most people, is planets have maximums on their colonists production rates. For instance, on unedited L class planets, you can put 20k colonists on fuel ore production "maximum". Any higher and it actually begins to LOSE fuel ore production capacity. Just play around with the pop numbers and find the max's on your particular game, to maximize effectiveness of your production.
