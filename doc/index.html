    <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
        Kokua is a <a href="http://www.eisonline.com">Trade Wars 2002</a> assistant with the goal of being very easy for the user to customize for their use.  Every screen is defined in user-modifiable <a href="http://www.swixml.org">XML user interface</a> files similiar to HTML.  All actions are written in JavaScript, the scripting language of web pages, eliminating the difference between scripts and normal application behaviors.  The initial emphasis of the project is to explore visualization and data mining.
        </p>
        <p>
        Kokua was born out of a desire for an open source, Linux-compatible TW2002 helper, and a frustration working with the <a href="http://sf.net/projects/jtwat">J-TWAT</a> source code.  J-TWAT was/is a great helper, but in an effort to build the ultimate helper, code organization was sacrificed to make way for development speed making it difficult to build upon.  While Kokua borrowed many of the ideas of J-TWAT (like stream lexing triggers), Kokua is a complete rewrite.  To encourage development, pains have been taken to cleanly separate functionality and push as much code into external scripts as possible.  While JavaScript is used by default, many other scripting languages can be used.  Furthermore, all Trade Wars-related code has been separated from the main application to support other text-based games or applications.
        </p>
        <p>
        Kokua is <strong>NOT</strong> an attempt to create the ultimate TW2002 helper or scripting platform.  In fact, it has been built to work
        explictly with <a href="http://www.twxproxy.com">TWXProxy</a> (latest version at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/twxproxy-ep">Google Code</a>.
        Other helpers, like SWATH, have way more features than Kokua will probably ever have.  In particular, Kokua does not focus on scripting, leaving that to the faster
        and more capable TWXProxy.  Not that I'm against the idea of a fully-featured TW helper, I just don't have time or motivation.

      <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p>
            Kokua requires Java 5 or greater to be installed.  <!--The easiest way to run Kokua is to use <a
            href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Java WebStart</a>, which should be automatically installed in your web browser by the Java
            installation process.  Just click on the <a href="kokua.jnlp">Kokua WebStart link</a> and the program should automatically download and
            install itself.-->
        </p>
        <p>
            Kokua comes as a completely self-contained jar file.  For Windows users that have Java 5 installed, you should be able to just double-click on the file to run it.  You can also execute the jar by running "java -jar kokua-VERSION-standalone.jar" at a command prompt where VERSION is the version you downloaded.
